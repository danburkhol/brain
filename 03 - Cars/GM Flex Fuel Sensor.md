## Pressure side
- Might cause restriction or additional item on high pressure side to worry about
    - OEM do this and don't seem to be concerned
- Can capture fuel temperature better

## Return side
- If pump runs out of flow, regulator becomes dry
    - Only sample in vacuum to ensure 
- Can't measure fuel temp @ injector as effectively
