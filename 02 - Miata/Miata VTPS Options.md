    - It's generally recommended to NOT use third-party BMW TPS sensors. However I had great success with them.

## Adapters
- [Paired with Flyin Miata adapter](https://flyinmiata.com/products/tps-upgrade)
    - Highly suggest getting their metal adapter for a 3D printed one. 
    - Thermal expansion / contraction can introduce some instability in TPS read outs in my experience
