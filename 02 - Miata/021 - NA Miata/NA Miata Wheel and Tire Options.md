# Tecna's
- Ideally suited to 185-205 width tires above 280 treadwear on 6-8″ wheels
- Pinch weld ride height measurement assumes a 22.8~23.0″ tall tires (185-60-14, 195/50/15, 205/50/15 225/45/15)
- standard front setup provides enough bump travel for a 205/50/15 tire on a +36 offset 15×8 to just barely kiss the fender liner at full bump.
    - 15x8+36 w/ 205/50/15 
- Wider tires or lower offset wheels will require removal of plastic inner fender liners in front.
- If running 245/40/15 tires or touching the front fender liners on big bumps, add our [shock mount spacers](https://949racing.com/product/5-mm-top-hat-spacer-90-05-miata/) or [travel limiters](https://949racing.com/product/xida-travel-limiters/) to create enough space for your oversize tires.

# Tires

- if you go x8, you get ECS, if you go x9 you get RS4s

CJ | NobyI — Today at 5:31 PM
ECS 205/50 on 8s (wet grip)
RS4 225/45 or 245/40 on 9s (long lasting quality 200TW)
ECFs are like RS4s, but more cost and maybe softer sidewall.
Only other option really would be RT660s in 225/45 or 245/40 if you wanted more peak dry grip than what RS4 has to offer
16s are bad for tires, it's an in-between size, you don't get anything new really 

There's really just no reason not to go 9s if you're 1) not getting ECS and 2) Rolling fenders slightly
