Seems like FC RX-7 alt is the pro-move

> For the NA6, the RX-7 FC (1985-92ish) alternator is nearly a direct bolt in with little change required. Similar to this shootout, the terminal should be changed so that the smaller 10mm nut can still be used, and the plug is in a different location. The V belt pulley is smaller by about 1/2″ in diameter, but the stock adjuster and belt can still be used. The beauty is that the case is nearly identical and no alterations are required. Even the stock NA6 bolt can be used. Eaglehigh on Amazon sells a 140 amp unit. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AY200TU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AY200TU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
> This is a great replacement for the NA6.
