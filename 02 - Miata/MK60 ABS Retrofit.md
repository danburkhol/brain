Key points from the image:
- Phil Foley has compiled a list of E87 and E90 MK60E5 unit part numbers and software versions.
- The list is intended to be used as a reference for people who are looking to upgrade their ABS units.
- Jason Howerton asks how to differentiate between MK60E1 and E5 units.
- Phil Foley responds by posting an image that shows the difference between the two units.
- The E1 unit is on the left and the E5 unit is on the right.

Key points from the image:
- MK60E5 ABS units are inexpensive.
- They were used in all 6-cylinder BMWs from 2006-2012 (E90 chassis).
- They were also used in Z4 models (E93 chassis).
- They are readily available at salvage yards (e.g., the author's local pullapart had 6).

**Key points about MK60 ABS systems:**

- E9x M3 and E8x 1M models have stronger/larger motors in their MK60E5 units.
- 6-cylinder E8x/E9x MK60E5 units can be flashed with M3 software.
- Flashing a 6-cylinder E5 to M3 specifications provides good value.
- Converting E8x/E9x 6-cylinder to M3 involves copying the contents of M3.0pa (dscm90) into the OPA of the E8x/E9x (dsc90).
- This process uses Winkfp and is similar to updating a standard unit.
- After flashing, the E8x/E9x unit will function as an M3 unit.
