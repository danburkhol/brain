# Part Numbers
- BMW TPS Part Number: 13-63-1-721-456
    - It's generally recommended to NOT use third-party BMW TPS sensors. However I had great success with them.

## Adapters
- [Paired with Flyin Miata adapter](https://flyinmiata.com/products/tps-upgrade)
    - Highly suggest getting their metal adapter for a 3D printed one. 
    - Thermal expansion / contraction can introduce some instability in TPS read outs in my experience

You will need to source a linear TPS from the aftermarket or from another application. The easiest swap is probably a BMW TPS Bosch part # 0-280-120-402 from an auto E30 or E36, or Bosch #0-280-120-406 from an E32. Both of these should bolt on your miata TB w/o modification. You will need to adapt the wiring harness to accomodate. The BMW pinout is  
Pin 1-black wire-5volt in  
Pin 2-shielded wire-ground  
Pin 3-yellow wire-signal out  
Pin 4-ground  
Pin 5-WOT switch  
Pin 6-Closed switch
