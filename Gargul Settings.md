Here is how I configure and use Gargul to master loot efficiently with as little cognitive load on the operator as possible.



# Configuration

## Loot Trade Timers
- Using the Loot Trade Timer bars is the best way to track the loot to be rolled.
- Having the bars enabled, I can simply go down the list and `alt + click` to initiate a roll. 
- Once it's awarded, it's cleared from the list and I can move on. 
- No digging in bags to find things!!!
    - One exception is BoE Epics. Since they do not have a trade expiration, they don't show up here. 

- Note: I unchecked "Only show bars when I'm the master looter" so I could show the trade timers in the screenshot. I keep that checked otherwise.

## Autoloot

### Autoloot Item Rules
- Typically I'll autoloot everything to myself. 
    - But to save bag space, if you have a willing raider, you can assign items of a specific rarity threshold be sent to someone else.
- Autoloot _will not_ pick up untradeable items. So you do not have to worry about accidentally looting things like the Tranq Shot book or a Dragon Head.

### Roll Tracking
- I prefer to do a 10 second roll timer AND accept rolls 10 seconds after the rolloff ends. 
- Players actually have 20 seconds to roll on an item but are only exposed to the 10 second timer, giving them a sense of urgency. And it just feels better than 20 seconds some how.

### Awarding Loot
- Auto trading with the disenchanter during the rolloff is just a mess. Do it when you're all done.
