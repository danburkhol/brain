Bosch TMAP Sensors are a combined MAP and AIT Sensor that can be mounted on the intake manifold.

- Find a data sheet for pinout 
- Determine if it can be located in the manifold where the old air valve used to be
    - Physically it should fit, but I am unsure if it has enough exposure to the intake content to be of-use
        - Does it have enough depth to reach to potentially avoid heat soaking
    - [ ] Design new block off plate w/ provision for TMAP + ORING
