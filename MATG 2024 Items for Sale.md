## Goodwin Racing Street Single
- NON-APPEARANCE PACKAGE version
    - If you have an appearance package, the exhaust tip will be recessed a bit in your bumper.
- Includes their optional glasspack baffle
- I bought it used but didn't run it very long. With the rest of my exhaust setup it had too much drone for me.
    - My exhaust setup is: Goodwin MAXPOWER header, OEM midpipe, Goodwin SuperQ
- Also I _DO_ have an appearance package so I wasn't as big of a fan with how it was recessed in the bumper.
- If I had an otherwise stock exhaust, this is a great piece.
