# Step 1
Generate a JSON Schema from the following JSON body:
```
insert your json here
```
JSON Schema features include properties, objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, null, enums, conditional schemas, formats, required properties, additional properties, dependencies, references (refs), nesting, examples, and descriptions. These features help manage complexity, validate data, and generate rich documentation for easy understanding and working with JSON data. Examples from the source data is required and descriptions can be derived from the source data. Break up the {generated schema} into multiple files and utilize $refs where it makes logical sense. Identify objects that can be merged together or consolidated in some other fashion. Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.

# Step 2
{for each} of the {previously generated} {json schema files} , serialize the content of each file to a single line.

# Step 3
Write a PHP Script to do the following in a single execution: 
1. Define all of the {previously serialized} {json schema files} as an {associative array} where the key is the {filename} and the value is the {serialized content} 
2. Iterate over all of the {associative array} contents, deserialize the content using `json_decode({serialized content}, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT)` 
3. Write the {deserialized content} to a file in the `./schema` directory with the same {filename} as the {associative array} key
